# Bronco Express
üöç CLI application on Bronco Express ETA

### Background

This is my final project for my CS3800 course, Computer Networks; at Cal Poly Pomona.

### Objective

Write a program to read in at least 2 lines of input (with a specific format), do something meaningful using the network, and print out results in plain text.

### Problem

At my university we have a transit system called Bronco Express.  You can access information about where these buses are via the Cal Poly Pomona mobile app online.  You enter the route you want and the stop you're at.  I personally don't like it because you need to know which stops are apart of which route.

### Solution

My answer is to take the user's stop and desired destination and let them know which bus will get them to their destination the fastest and how soon it'll arrive, eliminating the need to know anything about the route system.
